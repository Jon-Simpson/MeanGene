# MeanGene
MeanGene is a class written in Python with the purpose of implementing an unsupervised method for identifying patterns of gene expression given a DEseq output. DESeq is an R package used for differential expression analysis on the count data of high-throughput sequencing. More information on DESeq can be found [here](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq.html). The name MeanGene was chosen because K-Means is the engine behind the method. The aim was to find groups of associated genes (i.e. genes relating to cancer, etc.) that were expressed differently between groups of samples.
