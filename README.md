# MeanGene
MeanGene is an unsupervised method for identifying groups of genes that are expressed differently between RNA-sequenced samples. The name MeanGene was chosen because the K-Means clustering algorithm is the engine behind the method, and the purpose was to find groups of meaningful genes (i.e. genes that all contribute to a certain function) that were expressed differently between groups of samples.
