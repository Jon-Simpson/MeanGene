# MeanGene
MeanGene is an unsupervised method for identifying groups of genes that are expressed differently between RNA-sequenced samples. The name MeanGene was chosen because K-Means is the engine behind the method. The idea was to find groups of meaningful genes (i.e. genes that all contribute to a certain function) that were expressed differently between groups of samples.
