# MeanGene
MeanGene is a class written in Python with the purpose of implementing an unsupervised method for identifying patterns of gene expression given a DEseq output. DESeq is an R package for differential expression analysis of count data in high-throughput sequencing. More information on DESeq can be found [here](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq.html). The name MeanGene was chosen because the K-Means algorithm is the engine behind the method. The aim was to find groups of associated genes (i.e. genes relating to cancer, etc.) that were expressed differently between groups of samples.
